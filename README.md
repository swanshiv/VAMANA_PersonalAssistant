## Introduction

VAMANA is designed to enhance user experience by offering voice-controlled interactions and synthesized speech responses. This personal assistant can perform tasks such as answering questions, performing calculations, and more.

## Features

- **Voice-based Interaction:** VAMANA supports voice commands and responds with synthesized speech output for seamless interaction.

- **Google Text-to-Speech:** Utilizes the Google Text-to-Speech API for converting text responses into spoken words.

- **Speech Recognition:** Utilizes the Speech Recognition API to process user voice commands.

- **Wolfram Alpha Integration:** Can answer questions and perform calculations using the Wolfram Alpha API.

- **Browser Automation:** Capable of performing browser operations through the Selenium library.

### Before using VAMANA, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `speech_recognition`
- `playsound`
- `gtts` (Google Text-to-Speech)
- `wolframalpha`
- `selenium`
- `chromedriver` (for Selenium)

## How to Use:
### Install required libraries:
<pre>
  pip install speechrecognition playsound gtts wolframalpha selenium
</pre>

### Clone this repository to your local machine:

## Limitations
VAMANA requires an active internet connection for speech recognition and Wolfram Alpha API usage.
The accuracy of speech recognition depends on microphone quality and environmental noise.
Exercise caution when using browser automation; consider security implications.
